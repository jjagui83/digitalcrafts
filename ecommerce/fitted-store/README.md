# React Project


## Description 

- This is a project that starts to show my beginning grasp of React funtionality.  
- It is a simple page that includes seeding my own data and having it render on the screen.   
- React Redux is also included, along with styled-components and hooks.   
- As of creating this README there is still some styling that I would like to implement before it is all finalized.
