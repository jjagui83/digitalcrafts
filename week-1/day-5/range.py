### Exercise #2 - FizzBuzz Part 2

# In your terminal, print the range of numbers from 1 to 100
# For every number that is divisible by 3, you want to replace it with the word "Fizz"
# For every number that is divisible by 5, you want to replace it with the word "Buzz"
# For every number that is divisible by 3 and 5, you want to replace it with the word "FizzBuzz"
# Example: it'll read like "1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz" and so on
# Use what has been covered plus some research (don't google FizzBuzz lol)

# for i in range(1, 101):
    
#     if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
#         print("FizzBuzz")
#     # print(i, end="")
#     if i % 3 == 0:
#         print("Fizz")

#     if i % 5 == 0:
#         print("Buzz")

#     else:
#         print(i)
